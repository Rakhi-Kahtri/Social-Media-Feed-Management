# Social Media Feed Management System

A simple and user-friendly social media feed management system that allows users to create accounts, log in, post content, like and comment on posts, and view personal or global feeds. This project was collaboratively developed by **Alvina Jiwani** and **Rakhi Khatri**.

### **Feed Features**
- View personal feed with all user-created posts.
- Explore a global feed containing posts from all users.

### **Interaction Features**
- Like posts with real-time updates (a user can like each post only once).
- Add comments to posts, with User IDs attached to each comment.
- Delete personal comments on posts.

### **Navigation**
- Console-based menu for seamless interaction:
  - Create an account or log in.
  - After login, perform actions like posting, liking, commenting, or viewing feeds.

## 🛠️ Concepts Implemented

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
   - Classes for Users, Posts, and Comments encapsulate data and behavior.

2. **Hash Tables with Chaining:**
   - Efficiently stores and retrieves user accounts while handling collisions.

3. **Linked Lists:**
   - Posts and comments are dynamically managed for easy additions and deletions.

4. **Static Arrays:**
   - Tracks likes to prevent a user from liking the same post multiple times.

5. **User Authentication:**
   - Ensures password validation for secure login.

6. **Dynamic Data Handling:**
   - Updates data (posts, likes, comments) in real-time during runtime.
